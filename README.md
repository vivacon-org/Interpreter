Viva is an imperative, lax, dynamically typed language, support OOP, first class function, inspired by JS.

The current version is implemented based on JVM lang and tree walk interpreter.

Based on the bare-bones logic, it should continue to grow into a new language that has its own Virtual Machine rather
than JVM.
